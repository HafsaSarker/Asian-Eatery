## Notes

While creating this app, I struggled with styling. Specifically centering my card components. It was solved by wrapping them all in a div in App.jsx file. Also, I was not sure why my navigation bar wasn't starting from the top of the page. I set margin and padding to 0 in both index.css and app.css file. I figured that I should add "margin: 0" and "padding: 0" to the body tag in App.css.
